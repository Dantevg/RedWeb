# RedWeb
RedWeb is a program, which lets you access webpages all around your world. It works a bit like the World Wide Web.
***RedWeb is still under comnstruction. Please come back later.***

### Installation
For RedWeb, you will need at least 3 computers with wireless modems.

- **Computer 1:**  
  These are the clients.  
  *Pastebin coming soon.*

- **Computer 2:**  
  This is the IDS (ID server). It is comparable with an DNS server in real-life and there is only one of it needed.  
  *Pastebin coming soon.*

- **Computer 3:**  
  These are the webservers. One webserver can have multiple domains hosted, that are registered on the IDS.  
  *Pastebin coming soon.*
