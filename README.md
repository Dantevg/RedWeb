# RedWeb
RedWeb is a program, which lets you access webpages all around your world. It works a bit like the World Wide Web.
***RedWeb is still under comnstruction. Please come back later.***

### Installation
For RedWeb, you will need at least 3 computers with wireless modems.  
Scheme:
```
Client 1  -----|                 |-----  Webserver 1
               |                 |
Client 2  -----+-----  IDS  -----+-----  Webserver 2
               |                 |
Client 3  -----|                 |-----  Webserver 3
...            |                 |       ...

```

- **Computer 1:**  
  These are the clients. An advanced computer and DvgFiles are required.  
  *Pastebin coming soon.*

- **Computer 2:**  
  This is the IDS (ID Server). It is comparable with an DNS server in real-life and there is only one of it.  
  *Pastebin coming soon.*

- **Computer 3:**  
  These are the webservers. One webserver can have multiple domains hosted, that are registered on the IDS.  
  *Pastebin coming soon.*
